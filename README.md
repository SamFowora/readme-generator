# Professionally-Funny-Readme-Generator

## Description

This is a README generator, made to streamline the process for making readmes. Against popular belief, I actually enjoy writing my own readmes - there's some sort of personality to it that way.
In terms of challenges, it was working out really minor bugs that wouldn't allow the generator to actually work. Overall though, I found it pretty smooth to get through.


## Installation

All that's needed for this to work is NODE.JS and you should be good to go.

## Usage
